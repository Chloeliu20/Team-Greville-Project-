# Team-Greville-Project

### Hi! Welcome to Team Greville's population project, there are two part of our codes. 

### "Part I" includes the codes for population statistics, datafrane functions and a few extra data visualization. 
### "Part II" include the codes for population pyramid and two lineplots. We also imported one of the population datafeam for drawing the pyramid. Be sure to download the dataframe as well when running the code. Lastly, please try to run the codes in jupyterhiub. Some of the plots don't render in google colab.
